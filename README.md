# TechBlog
Check out my website at http://techblog.pythonanywhere.com . 
A website on which users can add or share their knowledge by writing blog or they can read blogs written by others. You can also write blogs just for yourself and keep them private or else you can publish your post to the main blog page where everyone can read it. Django is used as backend language for this website. HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap3 is used for frontend of the website. If you have any suggestions about this website or you want to contribute in this project, then send me a message.
